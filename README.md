# Interpreter_PLC
PLC Interpreter Project by Vincent Portelli, Michael Smith, and Thomas Lerner.

## How to run the Interpreter
* Run `Interpreter3.rkt` and call `(interpret '"<filename>")` such as `(interpret '"code.txt")`. 
* The interpreter will return the value returned by the given code in the file. 


## To do: 
- [ ] Make parser work with Dr. Racket
- - [ ] As with the previous parser, this one is written for R5RS scheme, and you will need to comment/uncomment some lines to use it with racket.

- [ ] Add function support 
	- [ ]
